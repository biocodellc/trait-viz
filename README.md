# trait-viz

A javascript library for visalizing trait data stored in a document store. 
This code base was developd with the [biscicol-server](https://biscicol.org/) API and toolset.

This code was adapted from  https://github.com/fullscale/elastic.js

This code-base is meant to be added as sub-module to consuming applications.  
NOTE: I would ideally, 
like to be able to add these javascript libraries dynamically but, unfortunately, i could not
get this implementation to work.
